The project is about leaning and creating an appropriate software system for a address
book. Due to several reasons like overloaded features, complex UIs, limited free
features, etc. people hesitate to purchase an address book. Address books are meant
to be a simple and efficient way to store information.
“FormulaRacers” address book is built in such a way that it is cost effective and has
simple enough UIs for user to interact with. It allows users to add a racer of their choice,
update and delete the data according to their necessity. Moreover ,they can search for a
specific data to display everything about the racer and sort the information however they
like it. To top it all off they can also reset all the data with just a click.
This software is mainly designed to be an accessible solution while also prioritizing the
main functionality of an address book and making sure of affordability and ease of use.
